run_analysis takes an existing group of data, and reorganizes according to instructions in the Getting and Cleaning Data course. 

The information includes many different recorded variables that record observations of subjects performing a set of activities while
  carrying a mobile device. The point of the exercise is to take information which has been broken out, and recompile and filter according
  to the following: Organize all the variables (for both the test and training datasets) according to the type of activity performed 
  (running, walking, standing, etc.), and the subject performing the activity. Then take an average of only the observations of variables
  which measure any form of "mean" or "std". The resulting organized data is called 'grouped_data', and the goal is to ensure it meet
  the qualifications of 'tidy data'.
  
Included in this repo is the Codebook explaining all terms and data, the script called run_analysis.r, and the exported grouped_data called "tidy_dancer"
